the below solution is to deploy a private blockchain with 5 validator . here we are using cloud aws , container docker , iac terraform , monitoring cloud and for one click deployment jenkins 

1. creating a 5 diffrent container 
in which each validator hosting geth would run in a seprate container 
build the image and push it to repository for example ecr repository 


a) we can deploy 5 container in a single ecs cluster 
. create an ecs cluster by specifiying name and configuration setting 
. defining a task defination by mentioning image name and network  setting , variables and resource 
. creating a service that manages deplyoment and scaling of the container 
. launching ec2 instance with desired configuration to host the container with proper resource 
. setting up the load balancer 
. we can set up auto scalling group

b) we can deploy 5 container in a diffrent ecs cluster 
.create 5 vpc defining cidr block and subnets an deach each network wont overlap 
.create 5 diffrent ecs cluster by defining task , create servicses and we need to host each ecs cluster in each vpc
.create vpc peering so that each ecs cluster are connected to each other 
. setting up the load balancer 

2. provisoning the infrasructure 

. create terraform script tat pulls the images from ecr and deploy it in ecs cluster as per requirment 
. create a vpc network 
. create security group and attach it to the vpc created

3. monitoring 

. create a dashoard in cloud watch for ecs cluster and for other resource 
. create alerts so that we can manage or ecs clusters

4. deployment 

. can deploy using ci/cd by using pipeline script
